# Thesis Structure

## Introduction
- **Trends and Context**
- **Problem Statement**
   - Lack of practical guides for Small and Medium-sized Businesses (SMBs) transitioning to Infrastructure as Code (IaC)
- **Objective and Scope**
- **Methodology**
   - What are the steps involved in transitioning from traditional IT environments to Infrastructure as Code (IaC) for small and medium-sized businesses (SMBs)?
- **Structure of the Thesis**

## Theoretical Foundations
- **DevOps and IaC**
   - Definition and issues with defining the concept
   - Core problems it resolves
    - Silo Mentality
    - Basic Solution
   - Explanation of practices and terminology
     - Agile
     - Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment (CI/CD)
     - Version Control
     - IaC
     - Software Defined Networking (SDN)
     - Software Defined Computing (Virtualization, Container)
     - GitOps, DevSECOps, and GitSECOps
- **IaC Tools**
   - Configuration Tools
   - Provisioning Tools
   - Declarative vs Imperative approach
- **Pros and Cons of IaC**
   - Pros
     - Reduces human errors/Ensures consistency
     - Git version control
     - Automated deployments
     - Scalability
     - Faster delivery
     - Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)
     - Cost-saving
     - Minimizes knowledge gaps through central repository
     - Reproducible systems/Replication
     - Disposable and Dynamic systems
     - Serves as documentation
     - Automated testing
     - Improves efficiency
   - Cons
     - Resistance to change
     - Introduction of new risks
     - Overwhelming options for beginners
     - Lack of knowledge (within the company and in guiding resources)
     - Requires initial time and financial investment
   - Security issues
